3DGEOM.js
=========

Simple javascript files available for free.  These are extremely, beginner level java-script functions for programming beginners only.  This file is released into the public domain (see licsense document).  

Any useful javascript functions for web pages that have basic functionality that are currently not bundled into a package that is pre-licensed, would be useful to those willing to expand the javascript library provided here for beginniners, or those who are looking for an extensive library of javascript functions for custom-coded webpages without having to depend on popular bundled javascript libraries that may have limits on use or licensure.  

This GITHUB library is started by Chris Leggett, the web coder of aeons.com and 3D developer in hopes of creating an expanded library of simple javascript codes that can be called in pages for those unfamiliar with javascript who may need to use small snippets of .js code on their pages.  

Thank you for helping make contributions, and I will try to moderate and organize the scripts into libraries based on behavior and utility.  If you add javascript functions to this document, please try to use folders and note with some type of README document how your script functions. 

-- Thanks for your collaboration in this beginner level project.  I hope the usefuless of this project and exact purpose of the document is clear.

PURPOSE: to organize a library of free, unlicensed .js functions that are useful for web developers who need to create custom .js files for use in commerce and business (or personal websites otherwise not specified) when they need to incorporate javascript functions on their page, and for developers who need to take credit for the scripts as the sole author. 

In this sense, devleopers would be responsible for custom coding, and the codes here would be a reference library for javascript programmers.  Your contributions would be very much appreciated, but with several pertinent notes for contributions.

CONTRIBUTIONS
=============

1. Only public license javascript or donations of working .js examples should be cited to contributions. 
2. I will not remove author names from the contributions here under any circumstance, as I appreciate your interest in this beginner level repository. 
3. I want to make something that is easy to follow and implement into most simple html web pages. 
4. I will also include .html, css, php, and other files that may be used to demonstrate more exciting developments on this page, and I will load those files into the appropriate folders so the working sites may be run locally on your machine, or uploaded to your personal website. 


PURPOSE
=======

1. To provide working exapmles of javascript for contributors, users and web developers. 
2. To continue to expand on those examples to create a FREE library of scripts. 
3. We will upload the final project as a .javascript library (akin to other libraries that impart function to pages) and upload the file under MIT license (crediting all contributors on the webpage prismxl.com.
